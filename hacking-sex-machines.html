Bluetooth sex toys are awkward to work with.
In this entry, I will outline my process for figuring out what to do in order to crack into the fun.

<h2>Connecting</h2>
Connections are pretty weird.
Programmatically connecting to Bluetooth devices requires a device address and the <a target="_blank" href="https://www.bluetooth.com/blog/a-developers-guide-to-bluetooth/">Characteristic</a> you will be playing with.
Getting the device address is straightforward, since it is simply the device you want to play with.
Characteristics however, are a bit annoying.
Bluetooth devices can have very few Characteristics, or have Characteristics with good names, making it easy to guess which Characteristic is correct.
However, some devices have many, nameless Characteristics, so finding the right one can be a chore.

I run into a few issues with my personal setup.
For starters, I don't have a VM set up for running apps (and my phone isn't rooted).
Therefore, I cannot sniff the Bluetooth packets.
<b>I highly recommend you go this route if you can easily set this up.</b>
I also have a cheap, USB Bluetooth adapter, so my connections are very slow. 

When connecting to a Bluetooth address, you can <a target="_blank" href="https://ianharvey.github.io/bluepy-doc/peripheral.html#getCharacteristics">look up the Characteristics</a> of the device.
To help pick the right one, you may wish to <a target="_blank" href="https://ianharvey.github.io/bluepy-doc/peripheral.html#getCharacteristics">see what properties each Characteristic has</a>.
We'll want to pick something that is writable, because we'll want to be able to tell the device what we want it to do.

Another thing to note is that apps sometimes have the UUID for the Characteristic hardcoded.
I was able to look this up by <a target="_blank" href="https://apkcombo.com/auxfun/com.auxfun.app/">downloading the app</a> and decompiling it using an <a target="_blank" href="https://www.decompiler.com/">online decompiler</a>.
From there, you may be able to use grep to search for UUIDs:
<code>
  $ grep -ri bluetooth .
  ...
  ./com/hismith/hismithapp/utils/Constans.java:    public static final UUID UUID_BLUETOOTH_NAME_WRITE = UUID.fromString("0000ff91-0000-1000-8000-00805f9b34fb");
</code>

<i>I didn't type that wrong, that is the actual name of the file.
<b>Do not expect good code from these apps.</b></i>

<h2>The Protocol</h2>
Another example of how Bluetooth is weird is the fact that the vendor can send whatever they like.
You may encounter human readable messages, like with Lovense devices, such as "vibrate:1".
However, you may also encounter binary data being written.
The suggested solution of sniffing packets may not always work, because there could be a bizarre schemes like in the later example. 

In the previous step, I mentioned downloading the app and decompiling it to look at the Bluetooth code.
This can be very useful when dealing with binary messages (subject to code quality).
For <a target="_blank" href="https://www.auxfun.co.uk/">Auxfun</a>, I found a few different methods to help me discover what data I should be sending.
They have a very odd <a target="_blank" href="https://www.decompiler.com/jar/012755e0a2e9411e98c8bddbcaf191ee/Auxfun_1.2.4_apkcombo.com.apk/sources/com/hismith/hismithapp/product/ProductBaseControl.java">protocol</a>:

1. Prepend 0xCC (I guess 0xAA is for something else I'm not using).
2. The code for the action (such as 0x03 to control thrust speed).
3. A parameter, if applicable (otherwise 0x00).
4. The sum of the code for the action and the parameter (not sure if for bad encryption or for some sort of <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parity_bit">parity scheme</a>?).

This was all done from hex strings (which I guess the devs just had to memorize) getting converted to bytes.
I guess the devs didn't know that you can just write hex literals in Java? 
Code quality aside, the scheme was cracked.
I could now perform the basic controls of my device.

Stop: 0xCC 0x02 0x00 0x02
Thrust Speed: 0xCC 0x03 N (0x03 + N)
