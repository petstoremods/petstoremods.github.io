<h1>Fucking Myself in DarkSouls... Literally</h1>

<pre style="overflow-x:auto;word-wrap:break-word;white-space:pre-wrap">
In my <a href="elisp-buttplug.html">last article</a>, I experimented with connecting to my <a href="https://www.lovense.com/">Lovense</a> devices in Emacs.
I decided to take this a step further with a little game hacking.

<b>tl;dr: I tied the vibrations of my toys to in-game attributes, such as souls.
The <a href="https://github.com/petstoremods/pup">source code</a> is public. It has some paths you might want to change, but it's available if you want to try it out.

<h2>Reading Game Memory</h2>First, I needed to create a process to read memory of games at an arbitrary location.
This allows me to use Cheat Engine tables to get any value I may want to bind my toys to.
I already had the code for vibrating my toys, so with these two features
I would be able to create a simple function to vibrate the toy depending on how I saw fit.

For example, I could bind souls in Dark Souls such that my toy buzzed whenever the count changed,
or I could bind it to my lust in Tailbound, making it vibrate harder the higher it got.
I think the most fun I had was with the `playermovementenabled` (set to false when having sex) in Skyrim.

Linux makes reading memory incredibly easy. If you can open a file, then you can read memory in Linux:

<div class="code">
  def read_bytes_at_address(pid, address, width):
    with open(f'/proc/{pid}/mem', 'rb', 0) as mem_file:
        mem_file.seek(address)
        return mem_file.read(width)

</div>

<h2>Nice UI</h2>I was in a wonderful world, but there was a problem.
I had to copy offsets and bluetooth IDs from files, `pgrep` for process IDs, and swap around functions.
So I did the only logical thing and gave it a UI, but instead of graphics, 
I found <a href="https://pypi.org/project/simple-term-menu/">simple-term-menu</a> to work beautifully for the lists of options I wanted to pick from.

I named this program "pup", mostly because it has three letters, but it's also almost kinky.
pup has two modes, "fetch" and "play", to manage configuration and execution, respectively. 

Play is obviously the mode I use more, but there isn't much to it.
The program will simply, automatically detect what game I'm running,
then it will prompt me for the offset I want to use, what toy I want to bind it to, and what mode to play in.

In fetch, I can select a new bluetooth device and give it a name I'll remember.
I can also type in the name of a game that I want the program to be able to detect later,
and give that game offsets that can be used to bind to the fun stuff >:).
The best part is all of this configuration is saved, so I'll be able to reinstall this program and all my setup by cloning the repo.

<i>I am expecting to share regular commits as my lewd gaming shenanigans continue.</i>
