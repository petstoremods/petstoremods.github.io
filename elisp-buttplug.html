<h1>3 Reasons I use Emacs for my Buttplug</h1>

<pre style="overflow-x:auto;word-wrap:break-word;white-space:pre-wrap">
Let me guess, you use a "modern" editor like vscode  *smirks*. Hahaha.
Well, you wouldn't be here if you were a typical Emacs user. Otherwise this would just be another Friday. 

Now behold, my awesome power, and bow before me. 
Sparing the <a href="https://github.com/petstoremods/butt-el">implementation details</a>, I created a function that calls a process to vibrate my toy. 
This lets me do some <i>interesting</i> things. 

#+BEGIN_CODE elisp
;; Reason 1. Events
;; Emacs has hooks, which is basically an event you can subscribe a function to.
;; They are prefect for if you want to hook it into a (perhaps suacy) game,
;; or a heated conversation on telegram or irc.
;; However, they can also serve a functional purpose. 
;; Here I tell emacs to vibrate my plug if I ever misspell a word or type in a syntax error.
(add-hook 'flyspell-incorrect-hook '(lambda (beg end corrections) (vibe 1 1)))

;; Reason 2. Keyboard shortcuts
;; Emacs lets you keybind to anything.
;; I find I can control my device much more efficiently than in the app.
;; Here are some example patterns and bindings I use.
(defun relax ()
  (interactive)
  (vibe 10 1)
  (sleep-for 1.5) ;;remember the process is async. This doesn't need to be perfect, but we'll have ~.5 seconds between buzzes.
  (relax))

;; The only fun way to teach recursion:
(defun climb-helper (iter)
  (when (< iter 21)
   (vibe iter 1)
   (sleep-for 2)
   (climb-helper (+ iter 1))))

(defun climb ()
  (interactive)
  (climb-helper 0))

;; Note: `C g` will stop the loop, but the last `vibe` call will keep running until it's finished
(global-set-key (kbd "M-s q") 'climb)
(global-set-key (kbd "M-s w") 'relax)

;; Reason 3. GUI
;; Emacs makes writing GUI applications very simple. 
;; If I don't feel like using a keyboard, such as when a hand might be busy, then a mouse is perfectly fine. 
(insert-button "Easy"
  'action '(lambda (e) (vibe 1 1))
  'face 'eww-form-submit)

(insert-button "Medium"
  'action '(lambda (e) (vibe 10 5))
  'face 'eww-form-submit)

(insert-button "Hard"
  'action '(lambda (e) (vibe 20 10))
  'face 'eww-form-submit)
#+END_CODE

Let's just say the office lets me work from home now.
